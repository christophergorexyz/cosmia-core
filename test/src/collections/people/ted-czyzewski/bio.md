Ted has been part of the Razorfish Health team since 2014. He has worked alongside the creative team on a variety of consumer health and wellness projects. Since joining Razorfish Health, Ted has had the opportunity to work with a broad range of clients, including a global website development and launch for Johnson & Johnson DCOE (Canvas), Johnson’s Baby, a global website development for Zeltiq Aesthetics, (both consumer and HCP), Purdue (Hysingla ER, Butrans, and OADP website launches) and Pfizer.

Ted’s greatest pride is in his collaborative and flexible attitude, whether he’s working in his UX position or working alongside the design team creating design comps, searching for imagery, or QA testing a site. 

Ted has a BS in graphic design from University of the Arts. 

Outside of the office, Ted enjoys hanging out with family and friends, attending the newest art gallery shows, finding the best street art in and around Philadelphia, and dabbling in some competitive Irish dancing—and being a big Harry Potter nerd.
