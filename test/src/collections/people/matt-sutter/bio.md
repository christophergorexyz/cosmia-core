Matt has been in the advertising design field for over 17 years, creating websites both large and small, print books, branding, and mobile applications. Before arriving at Razorfish Health, he even had a stint as lead animator on a short-lived VH1 animated sketch show (you never saw it).  

Matt has been at Razorfish Health for 10 years, working with clients such as PNC Bank, Rite Aid, PEW Charitable Trust, St. Jude Medical, CoolSculpting, and most recently, Flintstones vitamins. He is passionate about design, typography, UX, and the amazing direction of the internet! He strongly believes in the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) ideology.  

Matt loves to illustrate and has incorporated this into many projects as iconography, spot illustrations, feature illustrations, or conceptual storyboarding. He has self-published several books featuring his drawings. In 2010, he coauthored a book of illustrations under Kensington Publishing, entitled “The Superest.” 

Matt earned a BFA in communication design from Kutztown University. He enjoys drawing comics, painting on bits of wood, and bicycling, and he will garden you a mean tomato if given the chance.
